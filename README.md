## Back-End Projects

### 2023

**NASA API Showcase** 

https://github.com/cverbout/NASA-API-Showcase

This project is an interactive platform that utilizes two of NASA's APIs: the Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) and the Astronomy Photo Of The Day (APOD). It displays a global map featuring natural events and offers a daily showcase of astronomical images. The application, developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask), is hosted on Google Cloud and employs Docker for deployment. This setup ensures reliable and scalable access to space-related data, demonstrating practical application of cloud hosting and containerization in web development.

**Python RESTful API**  

https://github.com/cverbout/Python-RESTful-API  

A Python-based web application for managing Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), marking my initial venture into backend development. Built using the Tornado framework, this project showcases functionalities like creating, retrieving, and deleting GUIDs. It integrates with a MySQL database and Redis for caching, highlighting key backend concepts such as asynchronous programming and database management. This project was a significant step in my learning journey, enhancing my understanding of server-side logic and API validation using Postman.

### 2022

**Check The Fridge** 

https://github.com/cverbout/CheckTheFridge

An innovative grocery tracker and recipe resource application, developed with ASP.NET following AGILE methodology. As part of a four-person team, my role focused on backend development, involving SQL database management, C# backend logic, user authentication, and frontend-backend integration. The project features a grocery tracker, recipe resources, and user authentication, all synchronized in real-time. This experience enhanced my skills in full-stack development, API testing with Swagger, and maintaining consistent database and server environments.



## Front-End Projects

### 2023
**Personal Webpage**  

https://github.com/cverbout/ChaseVerbout

A dynamic personal webpage integrating NASA's Photo API to display space-related data. This project, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features responsive design and asynchronous API calls for a seamless user experience. My role encompassed creating an engaging layout, styling with CSS for visual appeal and consistency, and implementing JavaScript for API integration and dynamic content loading. This webpage demonstrates my frontend development proficiency and ability to work with external data sources.

### 2021
**California Coast Disability Access** 

https://github.com/cverbout/BeachAccess

A comprehensive web mapping application developed as part of GEOG 458 at the University of Washington. This project utilizes HTML, JavaScript, CSS, QGIS, Leaflet, and jQuery to create two interactive web maps. The application aims to inform about and improve disability access along the California coast, providing vital statistics by county and locating accessible beach access points. The project emphasizes the need for equity in public infrastructure, aspiring towards 100% disability accessibility at beach access points.
